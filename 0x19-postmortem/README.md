## Overview
Welcome to the rollercoaster ride of our latest project release! Buckle up as we navigate through the highs and lows of a wild outage adventure that almost brought the internet to its knees.

## Issue Summary
- **Duration:** From the crack of dawn till the twilight hours, this outage kept us on our toes for a whopping 13 hours!
- **Impact:** Picture this: users clicking frantically, servers sweating profusely, and a chorus of 500 Internal Server Errors echoing in cyberspace. It was chaos, to say the least!
- **Root Cause:** Brace yourselves... a single typo in our WordPress application code turned the web server into a comedy of errors. Who knew one missing letter could cause such havoc?

## Timeline
- **06:00 WAT:** The sun rises, and so does our project... along with an unexpected error message.
- **19:20 PST:** Bug debugger Brennan (a.k.a. BDB) enters the scene, armed with determination and a trusty magnifying glass.
- **19:25 PST:** The hunt begins! Brennan sifts through processes, config files, and more, determined to crack the case.
- **19:30 PST:** Enter the strace! With a flick of the wrist (and a command in the terminal), our hero uncovers the elusive typo.
- **19:45 PST:** Victory is near! Brennan corrects the typo, unleashing a sigh of relief across the digital realm.
- **19:50 PST:** Testing, testing... 1, 2, 3! The server responds, and peace is restored to the kingdom of cyberspace.
- **19:55 PST:** With a flourish, Brennan scripts a Puppet manifest to ensure the typo never dares to resurface again.

## Root Cause and Resolution
In a twist of fate, a simple typo ("phpp" instead of "php") in our WordPress application code triggered the domino effect that led to the outage. Brennan swiftly corrected the error, restoring order to the digital universe. As a failsafe, a Puppet manifest was crafted to fend off any future typos attempting to wreak havoc.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
To safeguard against future outages and keep the internet running smoothly, we've cooked up a recipe for success:
1. **Test, Test, Test:** Thorough testing procedures will be our shield against typos and other pesky bugs lurking in the shadows.
2. **Keep Watch:** Uptime-monitoring services like UptimeRobot will be our ever-vigilant sentinels, alerting us at the first sign of trouble.
3. **Automate to Liberate:** Automation tools like Puppet will be our trusty sidekicks, standing ready to swoop in and save the day at a moment's notice.

## Conclusion
And so, dear reader, our tale comes to a close. Though fraught with challenges, this outage served as a valuable lesson in resilience, resourcefulness, and the power of a well-placed semicolon. As we bid farewell to the chaos of today, we look forward to a brighter, typo-free future in the vast expanse of cyberspace.

But hey, where's the fun in perfection? After all, it's the bumps in the road that make the journey memorable. Until next time, keep coding, keep laughing, and never underestimate the power of a single keystroke!
